Hills and the people are aound them
Ups and Downs
Above the clouds
Lovely people around
Green evrywhere
Nature starts there
Fresh Air to breathe 
Rain and Sunshine
Evenings with rum and wine
Millions of stars to spot
Hundreds of culture to know
Hundreds of foods to try
The big hard rocks
Morning alarm by the cock
Days start and ends with fog
