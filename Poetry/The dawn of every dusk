There is a dawn of every dusk,
It will take time, because the rise of Sun is must,
A new whole day, something like you have hit the refresh button,
Let her go, because there is a dawn hidden few hours away
It's dark, or the moment to see through closed eyes.
It's not permanent. There is a dawn coming.
