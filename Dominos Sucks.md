## Dominos Sucks

"Ah, Dominos Sucks" these words came out when I ate Dominos for the first time. I felt Dominos/Pizza is the worst kind of food in the world when I ate it for the first time. I think of throwing it to the food garbage but the hunger and 100 rupees that I invested to buy that didn't let me to do it.

Now after 6 years when I said the line "Dominos Sucks", It is the one of the best kind of Pizza that I prefer now to have. Why so? 

If you try a new food you might not like it because your tounge is used to Roti/Parrota and others and not ready for a new kind of a new kind of taste. But if you try having it more often you might start liking it.

Let's come to the point and forgot about the Dominos Pizza story for few minutes.

When I first tried the Ubuntu OS, I didn't liked it. It didn't give me the same experience as Windows. I was in love with Windows. Click next, next and next to install any software. Everything nicely setup for you to go start using the computational power of your machine.

For sure I was not aware of Proprietary or Free and Open-Source software (FOSS) then. I treated both as a piece of software. So what I was looking at was "User Experience", not through my idelogical or tecnological perspective, because I didn't have any. How someone who just knew the what is program and don't know how any softwares are built would even have any perspective. Here is my "Before College" life, I was just doing whatever I was told to do. Get 1st rank in the batch or be in top 1 percentile of the batch, score 300+ marks in JEE mocks. get into IITs/NITs, the success and failure story of relatives and neighnours and get a job to survive in this world. Questioning to any was equal to disrespecting them. Overall I was a bot who use to move based on program commanded by family and relatives. 

My day 1 in college. I was the most excited and most introvert and the guy with poorest spoken english skill and became the Class representative and the real and much needed struggle starts and I loved the challenges that I faced beacuse I knew there is learning only when you some challenges and solve it.

Now coming to the Ubuntu OS, I didn't liked the UX and didn't knew the Open-source nature of it so never think of solving the challenges that I faced on Ubuntu like -  why I can't see the Connect to Wifi option. As I said I treated Windows and Ubuntu as a piece of software and used Windows because everything was pre set-up once you install it. So never spend much time with Ubuntu.

Let's jump to my post-college life

I joined FOSS United [FU] to help the team to cordinate with FOSS Hack 2020 sponsors, participants, community partners, overall to make that hackathon happen and see some quality projects coming out of it. TBH I didn't have much awareness about what FOSS brings on plate compare to a proprietary software.

After the hackthon ends I had enough time to read and learn about FOSS, I started learning about people in the FOSS ecosystem, what they do, why they build FOSS. I started with watching videos of Rushabh's talks all over the internet learning about Kailash's work from his github profile, read their old interviews. I read all the articles from O'Rielly's "Open-Source, Voice from open source revolution". Now I had a bit of technical and a bit of ideological perspective of mine to explre and spend more time with Ubuntu and free softwares like Thunderbird, Mozilla, Installing and updating every piece of software from the terminal. Anand from team hosted a BigBlueButton instance for FU to use it for our e-meets.


Now I use free software for most of my job and I am loving the UX they provides. I am writing this story in markdown format, now I love using markdown more than Rich texts, but still there is a lot more to go, like contributing back to FOSS, especially to frappe framework which helped me use ERPNext for my personal website. I am in great debt of frappe framework now. 

I believe myself a story teller who is a very big introvert, doesn't make sense right? Okay, a bit more about me. I don't open my mouth until I have not anything to contribute in any conversation or discource. Till the second year of my college I don't use to open my mouth because I had done nothing significant till then. till then I use to voluneer tech community events and get to know about other volunteers, their journey what they are doing. Once I learn organizing tech events and start a community. I start creating community and organzing events just to experiecne how does it goes. I remember the first event that I organize on the occasion of International Women's Day 2018. Now I believe it was a huge success back then I didn't. 50+ female students listing to the journey of another female entrepreneur who has started a company in Australia and motivating young girls from a tier 2 engineering college to learn and start their own too. Since then I believed that I can speak about what I am contributing and thus feedbacks from the folks to improve it and learn more.

I am on my way to learn about programming and contribute to open-source and more than that - telling stories to group of people about free and open source software. 

Now let's get back to the Dominos story.

It took me more than year or I tried dozen pizzas (Yeah I order dominos once in a month, almost) of Dominos to get used to the taste of it and now of my favourite kind of Pizza. Similiarly after 3 months of spending with Ubuntu and Thunderbird and other softwares, along with the a bit ideological perspective of mine, I am loving them. And I would ask everyone to spend some time with FOSS before making a descision, like "Thunderbird Sucks"
