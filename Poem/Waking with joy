Waking with joy
End of the waiting hours to see someone
Hours of meaningless gossips
Overdramatic as usual
Celebrating without occasion
Sleeping and traveling during the occasion
Streets of Bangalore
Saying 'Hi' to random strangers
That's the story of past few months so far.

Lot more changes to experience
Lot more new people to meet
Lot more old people to make friend now
Lot more to learn how to forget some good old people
