The heavy heart
Never takes anything light,
The wet eyes
About to cry,
The shivering fingers
Don't know how to write,
It's always foggy
Day and night,
Since when it became like this
Older one was better and bliss,
I am familiar with this little heavy heart of mine
It always gets better, just need some time
