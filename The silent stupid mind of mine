The fear of speaking and writing are with me since I was kid. I use to fumble while speaking and mostly use to remember 
study materials to score good marks in exam. My school teachers expected from us to score 100/100 in maths, Science and 
General knowledge subjects probably because they believed getting better scores in those subjects would help us become 
an IAS / Railway employee. Nobody use to talk about creative thinking. Thus I became one who never used to open up about any thing.
The whole life use to run formulas. Similiar to the mathematics one. If you not use the particular formula, you won't get the result.
I remeber section A students used to bully section C students when I was in class  7th. I thought I have already lost the race. S
coring 80% on mid-term and final term was very difficult for me. 

I didn't studied Hindi till standard 1st. Schools in Nagaland start teaching Hindi from standard 2nd. Unluckily, I had to move to Bihar 
after my standard 1st. I got demoted to Nurserry class (pre KG-1) beacuse I had no idea about hindi language. I felt embarresed for 
2 years until I got promoted to standard 1st again. 2 years of downgrade overall.

I used be excited about hindi and english than any other subjects. I used to write exams papers with my whole heart. But the asks from 
family was mathematics.They had already things planned for me, crack JEE, become an engineer. I had no idea what does an engineer 
does. But I used to guess that I have to be good in mathematics to figure out my future.

As of now, the practice I did in math and science has secured me which my family and most of the family wanted from their child.
We can verify this statement by finding the ratio of students joining engineering colleges and students care/like engineering subjects.
I was one among hundreds of thousands who joined engineering in 2016 without the prior knowledge about what are we gonna learn there.

I started surfing internet when I was in class 12th in cyber cafe about list of best Non-IITs, Non-NITs in India, good colleges in 
south India, government colleges, what are differents engineering branches etc. I get to know that IT and CS have almost similiar 
subjects and lot of jobs.

Now my family and I am happy that I have a job which pay my bills and I won't die poor and in debt, mostly that's how lots of people 
from village die, poor and in debt. I have developed a habbit which doesn't let me speak and write stuff. Four years of college was 
best and worst 4 years of my life same time. Those 4 years teach me how to deal with boring stuff, like passing degree subjects in 
one night and do nothing at all during the week days. For the first years I was pretty doing nothing, few backlogs and watching 
Marvel movies, US sitcoms to work on my english listening skills. During the last few months of 2nd year of the college I discovered tech communities
which used to organize events of weekends. I started spending my Saturdays and Sundays at those event, later volunteered to promote those
events in my and nearby colleges. I started opening up myself in front of people, sharing my journey, learning from them. That's how I
get the courage to organize local meetups, lead national hackathons, became the President of IT association, started weekly and monyhly
meetups in software developement clubs, soft skill clubs, learned how to be as a team player, how to lead a program and gained a skill that
helped me to get my first full time job.

Still I haven't worked on my writing skills yet. The fear of getting judged by good writers always pushed me back whenever I wrote something 
and though of publishing it. I still have 21 drafts answers on quora, 16 small/medium articles/stories which I haven't published on medium.
I am still struggling to overcome this. I thought of making a daily routine of writing some vaious time, wrote few times but never worked on that well.

I guess this is the right time to do it. No one is ready me on quora. I will share my thoughts here. I might share on my [personal site](https://wishal..cc) later.
