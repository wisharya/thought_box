## The silent stupid mind of mine

The fear of speaking and writing is with me since I was a kid. I use to fumble while speaking and mostly use to remember study materials to score good marks in the exam. My school teachers expected us to score 100/100 in maths, Science and 
General knowledge subjects probably because they believed getting better scores in those subjects would help us become an IAS / Railway employee. Nobody uses to talk about creative thinking. Thus I became one who never used to open up about anything.
The whole life uses to run on formulas. Similar to the mathematics one. If you do not use the particular formula, you won't get the result.
I remember section A students used to bully section C students when I was in class  7th. I thought I have already lost the race. 
Scoring 80% on the mid-term and final term was very difficult for me. 

I didn't study Hindi till standard 1st. Schools in Nagaland start teaching Hindi from standard 2nd. Unluckily, I had to move to Bihar after my standard 1st. I got demoted to Nursery class (pre-KG-1) because I had no idea about the Hindi language. I felt embarrassed for 
2 years until I got promoted to standard 1st again. 2 years of downgrade overall.

I used to be excited about Hindi and English than any other subjects. I used to write exams papers with my whole heart. But the asks from family was mathematics. They had already things planned for me, crack JEE, become an engineer. I had no idea what does an engineer does. But I used to guess that I have to be good at mathematics to figure out my future.

As of now, the practice I did in math and science has secured me which my family and most of the family wanted from their child.
We can verify this statement by finding the ratio of students joining engineering colleges and students who care/like engineering subjects.
I was one among hundreds of thousands who joined engineering in 2016 without prior knowledge about what are we gonna learn there.

I started surfing the internet when I was in class 12th in a cybercafe about the list of best Non-IITs, Non-NITs in India, good colleges in south India, government colleges, what are differents engineering branches etc. I get to know that IT and CS have almost similar 
subjects and a lot of jobs.

Now my family and I are happy that I have a job which pays my bills and I won't die poor and in debt, mostly that's how lots of people from my village die, poor and in debt. I have developed a habit that doesn't let me speak and write stuff. Four years of college was the best and worst 4 years of my life same time. Those 4 years taught me how to deal with boring stuff, like passing degree subjects in one night and do nothing at all during the weekdays. For the first years, I was pretty doing nothing, few backlogs and watching 
Marvel movies, US sitcoms to work on my English listening skills. During the last few months of 2nd year of college, I discovered tech communities
that used to organize events at weekends. I started spending my Saturdays and Sundays at those events, later volunteered to promote those
events in my and nearby colleges. I started opening up myself in front of people, sharing my journey, learning from them. That's how I
get the courage to organize local meetups, lead national hackathons, became the President of the IT association, started weekly and monthly
meetups in software development clubs, soft skill clubs, learned how to be a team player, how to lead a program and gained a skill that
helped me to get my first full-time job.

Still, I haven't worked on my writing skills yet. The fear of getting judged by good writers always pushed me back whenever I wrote something and thought of publishing it. I still have 21 drafts answers on quora, 16 small/medium articles/stories which I haven't published on medium.
I am still struggling to overcome this. I thought of making a daily routine of writing some various time, wrote few times but never worked on that well.

I guess this is the right time to do it. No one is going to read my thoughts on Github. Thus I will share my thoughts here for the sake of writing something. I might share on my [personal site](https://wishal.cc/about) later.

P.S. - Pardon me for my terrible english.
